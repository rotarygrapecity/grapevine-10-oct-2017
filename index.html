                    <p>Good evening, welcome to the installation ceremony of the incoming board for the year 2017-18. Today
                        marks a change in the annual cycle, and I want to begin my speech by thanking our out-going president,
                        Rtn Asif Shaikh. Congratulations on an outstanding Rotary year Asif! You and your team have accomplished
                        a great deal and have made the name of our club shine brighter in District 3030. Thank you.</p>
                    <p>This year is the 101st year of the Rotary Foundation, and for me, my 10th year as a Rotarian. My Rotary
                        journey started in 2008. As a new member I was showered with affection and encouragement, I felt
                        “I belong here”, and this motivated me to take initiative. Through Rotary I have met many people
                        who have gone on to become friends, inspirations, and pillars of support. Being a Rotarian has also
                        given me the chance to serve our community. For this, and for all the people I have met through Rotary,
                        I am truly grateful.</p>
                    <p>As a Rotarian I have seen what a committed club can do. And this knowledge makes it is a moment of great
                        privilege, pleasure, and honour for me to be installed as President of our club. I accept this opportunity
                        with humility. Ours is a vibrant club, and my aim as president will be to build on the strengths
                        we have, and to create new strengths and positivity as we progress through the year.</p>
                    <p>“Whatever Rotary may mean to us, to the world it will be known by the results it achieves.” These words
                        by Paul Harris have had a profound impact on me. They remind me that service to society is the founding
                        ideal of Rotary. The incoming board and I envision that this year we will all come together to make
                        a difference in the lives of young children, and we hope that in the future when we look back at
                        this year, that is what Rotary Club of Nasik, Grapecity will be known for.</p>
                    <p>This year we will take the simplest of actions, actions which when repeated regularly and with love and
                        care will have magnified results.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Rotary International Focus Area - Wash In Schools - WINS will be our focus this year. With each member
                            of our club getting involved, we propose to reach 100 schools in and around Nasik, thus ensuring
                            hygiene and prevention of disease.</li>
                        <li>For the year 2017-18, we will also adopt a school and monitor 1000 students, with a focus on Anemia
                            and adolescent health.</li>
                        <li>This Rotary year we will continue to step up our outreach and attract new members to our club. We
                            will focus on mentoring our new members and supporting flexibility to allow Rotarians – young,
                            working, and retired - to make the most of their time, talents, energy, and passion to serve
                            humanity as only Rotarians can.</li>

                        <p>As Mother Teresa so beautifully said:-</p>
                        <p>“I can do things you cannot. You can do things I cannot. Together we can do great things. So friends
                            let us join hands and do great things.</p>
                        <p>Thank you</p>
                        <p>Rtn. Alka Singh</p>

                            <p>Dear Friends,</p>
                            <p>With this, I present you my report for the year 2016-17.</p>
                            <p>The year started with the bang, with the well attended installation ceremony which was unique
                                in itself as all the 16 rotary clubs, President &amp; secretaries were invited personally for
                                the installation which was held at Nasik club on 14th July.
                                <p>President Rtn. Asif Shaikh took over the charge from the outgoing president Rtn. Asha Venugopal
                                    &amp; outlined his plans &amp; visions for the Club.</p>
                                <p>As I start with the different avenues,</p>

                                <h3>Membership Development and Retention:</h3>
                                <p>It is only right for me to start with membership. What is impossible individually becomes
                                    reality when likeminded, kind hearted people come together for a common cause. We have
                                    to do more &amp; continue doing more &amp; more. We started with 39 members. On installation
                                    day we inducted 3 new members, Aishwariya Ganore, Anjali Aditya &amp; Col. Atre. We were
                                    happy to welcome Rtn. Chokani back with open arms. The Ground work for inducting 2 new
                                    members has been completed &amp; they will be formally inducted during the installation.
                                    They are Ms. Sandhya Jain &amp; Mr. Oke. The strength of the club will be 45.</p>
                                <p>Thanks to the efforts of membership director Rtn Anjali Mehta &amp; her team.</p>

                                <h3>Club Administration:</h3>
                                <p>Vice president Rtn. Vivek Saykhedkar did an excellent job by getting some excellent speakers
                                    from varied fields. They spoke on diverse topics from finance, insurance, GST, health
                                    &amp; nutrition, Education, social issues, personality development, Environmental issues,
                                    Spirituality, alternate healing therapies, Membership Development and retention &amp; many
                                    more. The effort was to invite speakers as per the designated months.</p>
                                <p>Fellowships at the weekly meetings &amp; felicitations during the Birthdays &amp; anniversaries went
                                    off smoothly.</p>
                                <p>Each Family night was held at different venue with delicious menus and fun filled games.
                                    The team efforts ensured an average attendance of 75%.</p>
                                <p>The first family night was held on 25th Oct 2016 at Quality Inn. The games conducted were
                                    Tambola &amp; finding your partner, everyone had a wonderful time.</p>
                                <p>2nd family night was held on 31st Jan 2017 at Hotel Surya, which was a well attended affair.</p>
                                <p>3rd family night was organized on 24th march 2017at Xion banquet of hotel Emerald Park. The
                                    food was divine and a lot of fellowship took place because of the ambience.</p>
                                <p>DG Mahesh Mokalkar’s official club visit too, was well planned and went as per schedule,
                                    with a breakfast meeting at hotel Emerald Park. He personally met each member of our
                                    club &amp; we all Rotarians were impressed with his motivational speech.</p>
                                <p>Keeping up with all new ideas the 15th charter night too was celebrated on 24th May in a
                                    unique way. This evening was the result of President. Rtn Asif Shaikh &amp; his team. A beautiful

                <p>Dear Fellow Trendsetter, Rotary Greetings!! First Lady Dr. Bhagyalakshmi joins me in congratulating you,
                    as you will be taking charge as Club President for the Rotary Year 2017-18. Thank you for taking the
                    project Blood Donation wholeheartedly on the first day of our Rotary year 2017-18. Friends, come 1st
                    July there is signal of arrival of a new Rotary year. And with that there is a change in the team of
                    leaders across the world. This happens year after year. A new team will take over the mantle of District
                    3030 with renewed energy, vigor and commitment.</p>

                <p>The methods may change, but our mission remains the same, that of SERVICE. What is impossible individually
                    becomes reality when like-minded, kind hearted people come together for a common cause on a platform
                    like Rotary. We have to do more and more good things to the World. The community needs us and we need
                    to send the message that we care and we are always there'. Rotarians and their families have been involved
                    for years in SERVING HUMANITY. I am very confident that you all must have done good homework and planned
                    to achieve the set goals. In a club small deeds done are better than great deeds planned. It will motivate
                    the members to participate in rotary activities in club level and the club will be a vibrant club.
                    <p>A club leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way to his members. Every President
                        is a fulcrum to his club, around whom all the activities occur. If the fulcrum is strong the club
                        functions effectively. And an effective club becomes a VIBRANT CLUB. And for the district to become
                        Vibrant every club must be empower to become vibrant.</p>
                    <p>The entire District Secretariat, Assistant Governors and Committee Chairs and team members are there
                        to give you support and guidance. Please feel free to contact us at any time and we all will be happy
                        to assist and guide. Remember we will be working together and closely to achieve our goals. As you
                        all are aware that the July month is the beginning of New Rotary year and I propose that we all as
                        a SMART TEAM 2017-18 will be together undertaking following projects for Smart beginning of 'Rotary
                        – Making the change'. I suggest the following:</p>

                        <h5>Greetings.</h5>

                        <p>District Directory is a very important communication tool for every active Rotarian of the District.
                            District Directory provides all the Rotary information and also specifies the Goals of the Rotary
                            for the year 2017-18. I am sure District 3030 Directory will be user friendly to achieve the
                            goals of Rotary during the year.</p>

                        <p>Our World leader and Rotary International President Ian H.S. Riseley’s concern on Environmental degradation
                            and global climate change are serious threats to everyone. They are having a disproportionate
                            impact on those who are most vulnerable, those to whom Rotary has the greatest responsibility.</p>

                        <p>To address many issues related to the community Rotary needs leaders who will help Rotary connect
                            with, represent, and better serve all of the members of our communities. Let us keep that spirit
                            of teamwork and cooperation always in our mind to take forward Rotary: Making a difference.</p>



                        <p>Mala joins me in wishing you and Mrs. Dr. Bhagyalakshmi a very purposeful and successful Rotary year
                            2017-18.
                        </p>



                        <p>With kind regards,</p>

                        <p>C. Basker Director 2017-19 </p>

                <h3>RIP Ian H. Riseley</h3>
                <p>9 February 2017</p>

                <img src="img/ian.jpg" alt="rotary grapecity" style="display: inline-block; max-width: 50%; padding:  0 5% 1% 0;" align="left">



                <p>Dear fellow Rotarians,</p>
                <p>Ask any Rotarian what led them to Rotary, and you’ll usually get different answers. Why? Because joining
                    Rotary is a personal journey. For me, it all began as a way to expand my business. My accounting practice
                    was new and I was looking to network, so I joined a local Rotary club. Soon, I was making more than just
                    business contacts, I was making friends and, most importantly, I was making a difference in my community
                    and beyond.</p>

                <p>No matter the path that took you to Rotary, we all have one thing in common: the belief in putting Service
                    Above Self. It is because of this commitment to serving others that we are able to confront some of the
                    world’s greatest humanitarian challenges. But we all know that our work isn’t finished yet. It can’t
                    be, as long as polio still affects any children anywhere, as long as water is still scarce for some,
                    and as long as education is still treated as a privilege rather than a right. After 110+ years, our work
                    is just getting started.</p>

                <p>I hope you will continue your journey with us, as we continue to serve our communities so that future generations
                    can thrive through Rotary: Making A Difference.</p>

                <p>Sincerely,</p>

                <p>Ian H.S. Riseley</p>
