            <p>Dear Friends,</p>
            <p>On 30th September we concluded our first trimester of Rotary year 2017-18. Through this period it has been heartening to see members coming forward and taking initiatives. We formed groups of club members, and this has helped us to share responsibilities and to enhance activities each month.</p>
            <p>We are working on getting all our members registered on My Rotary. During these three months there has been
            good attendance from members at regular meetings and projects. We shall also be inducting three new
            members in October. Our club is strengthening, and it is growing!</p>
            <ul>During the past three months we have:
              <li>Focused and increased our humanitarian service: Each month we have carried out both medical and non-medical projects which would be ongoing projects and shall have long lasting results. Our Interact clubs, both at Savitribai Phulle Vidyalaya and Kilbil School, are active, and young interactors are willing
                to  take up noteworthy causes.</li>
              <li>Enhanced Rotary’s public image and awareness by actively publicizing the work that we are doing. In the following months we shall engage in service projects, fundraisers and fellowship, where each member will
be able to use her/his individual talents toward supporting and serving our community with pride and distinction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I look forward to working with each of you within the wonderful framework of Rotary: Making A
            Difference.</p>

            <p>The test, which has been translated into more than 100 languages, asks the following questions: Of the things we think, say or do </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Is it the TRUTH?</li>
              <li>Is it FAIR to all concerned?</li>

            </ul>

            <p>Object of Rotary </p>

            <p>The Object of Rotary is to encourage and foster the ideal of service as a basis of worthy enterprise and, in particular, to encourage and foster:</p>

            <p> FIRST: The development of acquaintance as an opportunity for service; </p>

            <p>SECOND: High ethical standards in business and professions; the recognition of the worthiness of all useful occupations; and the dignifying of each Rotarian’s occupation as an opportunity to serve society; </p>

            <p>THIRD: The application of the ideal of service in each Rotarian’s personal, business, and community life;</p>

            <p>FOURTH: The advancement of international understanding, goodwill, and peace through a world fellowship of business and professional persons united in the ideal of service.</p>

          <p>What do we mean when we talk about peace?</p>

          <p>In 1921, the fourth object of Rotary was established: "The advancement of international understanding, goodwill, and peace through a world fellowship of business and professional persons united in the ideal of service."</p>
          <p>In Rotary today, we see peace not as an abstract concept but as a living, dynamic expression of human development, integral to our humanitarian mission.
          Much of our work for peacebuilding depends on the ability of Rotary members to execute three important activities: forming transformative partnerships, raising funds to support our many hundreds of projects, and recruiting and supporting Rotary Peace Fellows in their work.
          This year The Rotary Foundation formed a strategic partnership with the Institute for Economics and Peace, one of the leading organizations in identifying and measuring the attitudes, institutions, and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies.</p>
          <p>Through this partnership, Rotary will work with the institute to create an online learning portal for Rotarians and peace fellows to build on their current expertise, apply new methods, and mobilize communities to address the issues underlying conflicts. Our goal is to foster community-based projects in peace and conflict resolution that are practical and impactful.</p>
          <p>Rotary has also launched a Rotary Peace Centers Major Gifts Initiative to raise funds for new partnerships while continuing to garner contributions to educate and support our peace fellows and more.</p>
          <p>President Ian H.S. Riseley's six peacebuilding conferences – taking place globally from February to June – will explore the relationship among peace, Rotary's areas of focus, and environmental sustainability. Our history proves that you don't need to be a diplomat to make peace.</p>
          <p>When you mentor a student struggling to graduate, you are a peacebuilder.</p>
          <p>When you launch any project to support economic development in your community, you are building conditions for sustainable peace and conflict management.</p>
          <p>When you support and collaborate with a Rotary Peace Fellow, you are advancing peace.</p>
          <p>Today's complex conflicts require more creative community-based initiatives. Together we can really make a difference.</p>
