            <p>Dear Friends,</p>
            <p>On 30th September we concluded our first trimester of Rotary year 2017-18. Through this period it has been heartening to see members coming forward and taking initiatives. We formed groups of club members, and this has helped us to share responsibilities and to enhance activities each month.</p>
            <p>We are working on getting all our members registered on My Rotary. During these three months there has been
            good attendance from members at regular meetings and projects. We shall also be inducting three new
            members in October. Our club is strengthening, and it is growing!</p>
            <ul>During the past three months we have:
              <li>Focused and increased our humanitarian service: Each month we have carried out both medical and non-medical projects which would be ongoing projects and shall have long lasting results. Our Interact clubs, both at Savitribai Phulle Vidyalaya and Kilbil School, are active, and young interactors are willing
                to  take up noteworthy causes.</li>
              <li>Enhanced Rotary’s public image and awareness by actively publicizing the work that we are doing. In the following months we shall engage in service projects, fundraisers and fellowship, where each member will
                be able to use her/his individual talents toward supporting and serving our community with pride and distinction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I look forward to working with each of you within the wonderful framework of Rotary: Making A
            Difference.</p>

          <h3>Rotary Share Bazaar - 8th October 2017</h3>
          <img class="imgLeft" src="img/bulimg/ashaalkajyant.jpg" alt="rotary grapecity" align="left">
          <p>Rotary Club Nasik Grapecity in cooperation with Chaitanya Ashram organised “Rotary Share Bazaar” on the 8th of October at Ashwin Nagar Swimming Pool grounds. The Bazaar was conceptualised a month earlier, in mid September, and was inspired by the Diwali spirit of giving gifts and sharing.  </p>
          <p>In order to create a large and varied collection of items for the Bazaar, Rotarians and RotaryAnns donated New and Old (but in good condition) items that they themselves would have been happy to receive. This Bazaar was unique because we welcomed everyone who came to choose the items that appealed to them, rather than arbitrarily handing out items.  Thus this was truly a Bazaar  - a collection of things to browse and choose from. </p>
          <img class="imgRight" src="img/bulimg/crowdchoice.jpg" alt="rotary grapecity" align="right">

          <p>The Bazaar received 1230 visitors - needy beneficiaries who made their choice of sarees, shirts, trousers, jeans, dresses, dupattas, footwear, shoes, kitchen utensils, children’s clothes, bedsheets , travel bags, blankets, babywear, toys etc. Each beneficiary was given a shopping bag by the devotees of Chaitanya ashram, and they were then invited to walk around the bazaar and pick up things of their choice. </p>
          <p>This Project was spearheaded by RtnAnn Alka Khairnar, RtnAnn Abha Pimprekar, RtnAnn Archana Kaushik, and RtnAnn Manorama Agarwal. All Rtns and RtnAnns came forward with donations. Teams of Rtns and RtnAnns  worked dedicatedly in collecting, sorting out, and the stacking items together. We ensured that only items that were clean and in a good condition were accepted as donations.</p>
          <img class="imgLeft" src="img/bulimg/4ladies.jpg" alt="rotary grapecity" align="left">
          <p>The team of this event comprised of Rtn Asha Venugopal, Rtn Durga Sali, Rtn Madhuwanti Shidhaye, Rtn Radha Pillai, Rtn Minakshi Mittal, Rtn Kavita Dagaonkar, RtnAnn Alka Khairnar, RtnAnn Abha Pimprekar, RtnAnn Sheela Panchal, RtnAnn Lata Rajan, RtnAnn Medha Saikhedkar, and Rtn Jayant Khainer.

          <img class="imgRight" src="img/bulimg/linecrowd.jpg" alt="rotary grapecity" align="right">
          <p>Kudos to the President Rtn Alka Singh, Director Projects Run Meenakshi Mittal, and Director PR Rtn Jayant Khairnar for their motivation & enthusiasm, which kept the team going. The success of the project was possible in no small measure due to the devotees of Chaitanya Ashram & the blessings of Swami Sampoornanad. Their management of the beneficiaries helped the bazaar proceed in a well-ordered manner, and 1230 people had an enjoyable experience as they chose gifts for Diwali. </p>
          <img class="imgLeft" src="img/bulimg/sellingcrowd2.jpg" alt="rotary grapecity" align="left">

          <p>The members of Rotary Club Nasik Grapecity extend a heartfelt thanks to everyone who worked to make this Rotary Share Bazaar a success.

              <li>Is it FAIR to all concerned?</li>

          <p>What do we mean when we talk about peace?</p>

          <p>In 1921, the fourth object of Rotary was established: "The advancement of international understanding, goodwill, and peace through a world fellowship of business and professional persons united in the ideal of service."</p>
          <p>In Rotary today, we see peace not as an abstract concept but as a living, dynamic expression of human development, integral to our humanitarian mission.
          Much of our work for peacebuilding depends on the ability of Rotary members to execute three important activities: forming transformative partnerships, raising funds to support our many hundreds of projects, and recruiting and supporting Rotary Peace Fellows in their work.
          This year The Rotary Foundation formed a strategic partnership with the Institute for Economics and Peace, one of the leading organizations in identifying and measuring the attitudes, institutions, and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies.</p>
          <p>Through this partnership, Rotary will work with the institute to create an online learning portal for Rotarians and peace fellows to build on their current expertise, apply new methods, and mobilize communities to address the issues underlying conflicts. Our goal is to foster community-based projects in peace and conflict resolution that are practical and impactful.</p>
          <p>Rotary has also launched a Rotary Peace Centers Major Gifts Initiative to raise funds for new partnerships while continuing to garner contributions to educate and support our peace fellows and more.</p>
          <p>President Ian H.S. Riseley's six peacebuilding conferences – taking place globally from February to June – will explore the relationship among peace, Rotary's areas of focus, and environmental sustainability. Our history proves that you don't need to be a diplomat to make peace.</p>
          <p>When you mentor a student struggling to graduate, you are a peacebuilder.</p>
          <p>When you launch any project to support economic development in your community, you are building conditions for sustainable peace and conflict management.</p>
          <p>When you support and collaborate with a Rotary Peace Fellow, you are advancing peace.</p>
          <p>Today's complex conflicts require more creative community-based initiatives. Together we can really make a difference.</p>
